# Advanced-Marketing-Campaign-Governance-and-Compliance-Dashboard
For this project, we will use a dataset from Kaggle that provides detailed information on marketing campaigns. One suitable dataset is the "Bank Marketing" dataset, which contains data related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution

Develop a comprehensive dashboard that -
1. Tracks and manages marketing campaign compliance
2. Ensure all materials adhere to legal, compliance, and brand governance standards.

Adding Advanced Features
1. Predictive Modeling: Build a model to predict campaign success using features such as age, job, duration, etc.
2. Compliance Check Automation: Implement checks to ensure campaign materials comply with regulations.
3. Detailed Performance Analysis: Analyze performance metrics such as response rates, engagement rates, and conversion rates.
